EMAIL ANALYZER TOOL

Overview
The Email Analysis Tool is an innovative application designed to process and analyze email content. The tool provides a detailed summary of an email’s content, including key elements such as the sender, receiver, subject, and sentiment of the email. By leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies, this tool simplifies the analysis of emails and provides actionable insights in an efficient manner.
The core functionality of the Email Analysis Tool operates as follows:
1.	Input: The user inputs the body of an email.
2.	Processing: The tool processes the email using AI to extract and summarize the key details.
3.	Output: The tool outputs the summary, including: 
o	Sender: Information about who sent the email.
o	Receiver: Information about the intended recipient(s).
o	Subject: The main topic or subject line of the email.
o	Sentiments: An analysis of the emotional tone conveyed in the email, such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
This streamlined process allows users to quickly grasp the essence of any email, making the tool particularly useful for professionals managing high email volumes or researchers analyzing communication patterns.
Tools and Technologies Used
To build the Email Analysis Tool, the following technologies were employed:
1.	Backend Framework: FastAPI
o	FastAPI was chosen as the backend framework due to its speed, simplicity, and compatibility with modern Python features. It provides robust support for asynchronous operations, enabling quick and efficient handling of requests.
2.	AI Model: LLaMA 70B on Groq Cloud
o	The core processing and analysis of email content were powered by the LLaMA 70B model, accessed via Groq Cloud. This large language model (LLM) excels at natural language understanding and generation, making it ideal for tasks like summarization, extraction, and sentiment analysis.


3.	User Interface: Adapted from Claude
o	The UI was crafted by leveraging code from Claude, a conversational AI tool. This choice ensured a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, while enabling quick deployment.
Features
1.	Summarization: 
o	Extracts and condenses the key points from the email body.
2.	Metadata Extraction: 
o	Retrieves details such as sender, receiver, and subject.
3.	Sentiment Analysis: 
o	Provides an emotional assessment of the email’s tone.
User Interface Design
The tool's user interface is simple yet effective, consisting of the following components:
1.	Email Input Section:
o	A text box where users can paste the body of the email they want to analyze. For example, the input might include a formal email about scheduling a meeting.
2.	Analyze Button:
o	A prominent button labeled "Analyze" initiates the processing of the email.
3.	Analysis Output Section:
o	The results are displayed in a well-structured format under headers such as: 
	Introduction: A concise summary of the email’s intent.
	Objective of the Meeting: The primary goal or purpose outlined in the email.
	Key Points: Bullet points highlighting the crucial elements of the email.
	Call to Action: Any specific actions requested by the sender.
	Conclusion: A summary emphasizing the email’s overall tone and intent.
This design ensures clarity and provides a comprehensive understanding of the email content at a glance.


Sample Workflow
Consider an email from Rajesh to Shiva regarding a proposed marketing strategy. Upon analyzing this email:
1.	Input:
o	The email text is pasted into the input box, detailing the meeting proposal, objectives, and call to action.
2.	Processing:
o	The AI model identifies key details such as the subject (marketing strategy), sender (Rajesh), and sentiment (positive and professional).
3.	Output:
o	The tool displays the following structured analysis: 
	Introduction: "The email is a formal invitation from Rajesh to Shiva to discuss a new marketing strategy that could benefit the company."
	Objective of the Meeting: "To discuss a proposed marketing strategy that includes innovative approaches to enhance the company's brand presence, engagement, and overall success."
	Key Points: 
	"The proposed strategy aligns with current market trends."
	"Rajesh values Shiva's insights and expertise in shaping the strategy."
	"The meeting is scheduled for 21st January 2025, with flexibility to adjust the date if needed."
	Call to Action: "Shiva is asked to respond with a preferred time for the meeting or suggest an alternative date that suits his schedule."
	Conclusion: "The email is a polite and professional invitation to collaborate on a new marketing initiative, with the goal of benefiting the company's objectives."
